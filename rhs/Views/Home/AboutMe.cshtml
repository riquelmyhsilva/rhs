    <h3>biography</h3>
    <p class="biography-text">
        Born in 2006, I had my first contact with technology when I was 5 years old. I started
        to learn how to use the computer to access the internet and play games, since then I never stopped being
        interested in computers. At the age of 11, I discovered the world of programming and became interested in
        game development, starting my studies with the Java language, programming some simple games. At the age of
        16 I started the computer technician course at Senac Education Agent, obtaining general technical knowledge
        of the computing world, such as hardware, networks, and programming itself. From there my programming
        knowledge began to evolve exponentially.
